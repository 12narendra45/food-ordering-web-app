## 📚 Use Case

1. A customer enters the restaurant and is provided with a tablet or QR code to access the web app.
2. They select their **table number**.
3. They browse the digital **menu** and add items to their cart.
4. As items are added, the **total bill** is automatically calculated.
5. Once ready, the customer proceeds to **confirm** the order and it is sent to the kitchen system (future enhancement).
